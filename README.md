# BrickGame
The race car game from Tetris consoles as an experiment to experiment game development. 

I didn't use canvas, all the 'pixels' of the game are an actual html element.

Play it by accesing https://fdruga.github.io/BrickGame/

Code is all over the place, mistakes were made but it was a good way to discover flaws and mistakes in development process.

- Control the car with the left-right arrow keys.
- Touch controls are implemented. Indication about placement of the touch controls is shown at the start of a game.
- The game will indcrease speed over time.
- The game container is manually resizeable (check out the resize hanlde at the bottom right)
