# BrickGame
The race car game from Tetris consoles as way of learning game development. 

I didn't use canvas, all the 'pixels' of the game are an actual html element.

Other than that, classic game develompent tick was used to render each fram of the game.

Code is all over the place, mistakes were made but it was a good way to discover flaws and pitfalls in a game development process.

- Control the car with the left-right arrow keys.
- Touch controls are implemented. Indication about placement of the touch controls is shown at the start of a game.
- The game will indcrease speed over time.
- The game container is manually resizeable (check out the resize hanlde at the bottom right)
